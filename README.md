# Skin-Cancer-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-
This project focuses on skin cancer detection using deep learning, aiming to support early identification of malignant skin lesions through image classification. The system analyzes dermoscopic images and classifies them as Benign or Malignant, highlighting potentially high-risk cases.
